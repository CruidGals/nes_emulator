# NES Emulator

Contains emulation of the MOS 6502 CPU and (soon) the machine hardware of the original NES.


## Goals

- Hone low-level programming knowledge through deep analysis of Assembly code
- Practice C++ skills in managing memory, maximizing efficiency, and improving readability of code.
- Gain deep understanding of emulating machine hardware and connecting it to the 6502 CPU.
- Have fun, and hope to emulate all NES Games there is.

## TO-DO List

- Implement memory mirroring for CPU ram. (IMPORTANT)
- Try and emulate the pins on CPU
- Learn NES hardware, especially the architecture that connects the PPU and CPU together.
- At least make it able to run Donkey Kong
